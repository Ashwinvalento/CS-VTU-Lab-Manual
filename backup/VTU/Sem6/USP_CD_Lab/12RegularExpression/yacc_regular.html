<h2>Aim:</h2>

<h3>Write a yacc program that accepts a regular expression as input and produce its parse tree as output.</h3>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yacc- Yet another C Compiler defines what it is all by itself.  Computer program input generally has some structure; in fact, every computer program that does input can be thought of as defining an ``input language'' which it accepts. An input language may be as complex as a programming language, or as simple as a sequence of numbers. Unfortunately, usual input facilities are limited, difficult to use, and often are lax about checking their inputs for validity.</p>

<p>Yacc provides a general tool for describing the input to a computer program. The Yacc user specifies the structures of his input, together with code to be invoked as each such structure is recognized. Yacc turns such a specification into a subroutine that han- dles the input process; frequently, it is convenient and appropriate to have most of the flow of control in the user's application handled by this subroutine. </p>

<p>Every Yacc specification file consists of three sections: the declarations, (grammar) rules, and programs. The sections are separated by double percent ``%%'' marks. (The percent % is generally used in Yacc specifications as an escape character.)
In other words, a full specification file looks like</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    declarations
    %%
    rules
    %%
    programs
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The declaration section may be empty. Moreover, if the programs section is omitted, the second %% mark may be omitted also;thus,the smallest legal Yacc specification is</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    %%
    rules
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following command:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        yacc grammar.y
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>draws yacc rules from the grammar.y file, and places the output in      y.tab.c.</p>

<p>The following command:
    yacc  -d grammar.y
  functions the same as example 1, but it also produces the y.tab.h file            which would contain C-style #define statements for each of the tokens 
  defined in the grammar.y file.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Algorithm:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start</li>
<li>Accept an expression from the user.</li>
<li>Check for the structure that satisfies the conditions of a regular expression.</li>
<li>Print the parsed tree as output as when the conditions are satisfied.</li>
<li>End</li>
</ol>
